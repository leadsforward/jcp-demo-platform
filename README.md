# JobCapturePro Core

This theme is the Phase 1 WordPress scaffold for the JobCapturePro public website, directory, and estimator.

It reuses the existing demo UI assets from the repository (CSS/JS) and renders minimal page shells. WordPress is acting as the host, not the UI brain.

Phase 2 will wire WordPress data and CPTs such as `jcp_companies` and check-ins. Phase 3 will handle optimization and page-specific asset loading.
